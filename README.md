# Movie_Library_Project

I have created this web app by using MERN technologies for backend, frontend and database management.

# Features of this web app: 

- User Authentication: User can signup and login which stores password in end to end encrypted format, also admin can login itself to make changes in the website
but new admin can only be created from backend and database only.

- When user opens website then it will directed to homepage of our website with user and admin tabs only, but when it get logged in or signup then playlists and profile and logout tabs are visible to the user.

- We can view the details of the listed movies, and if user wants to add them to playlist then user can click on add to playlist button to add that particular movie to playlist listed or to new playlist which can be created there and visible after reloading.
